DJ's Pirate-Game

This is my EW000 final project game.

This game involves two pirate ships who are ganist eachother.

On the left is Pirateship 1, and on the right is Pirateship 2.

Both ships have the same capabilities and same health of 3.

You can gain health by going over a powerups but be careful, you don't want to run into the islands becuase you will lose 2 health and don't try to get the powreup too soon because the health limit is 3.
If you get hit by a cannonball you only lose 1 health.

Pirateship 1:
This pirate ship is controlled by WASD keys.
"W,S" control forward and backward movement, "A,D" control which way the ship rotates.
"Q" is used to fire cannon.

Pirateship 2:
This pirate ship is controlled by Arrow keys.
"UP, DOWN" arrows control forward and backward movement, "LEfT, RIGHT" control which way the ship rotates.
"SHIFT" is used to fire cannon.

When a ship wins, click on the mouse to exit game.

Use the spacebar to start the game when it loads, and
